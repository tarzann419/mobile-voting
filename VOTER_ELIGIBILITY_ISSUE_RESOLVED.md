# 🚨 Voter Eligibility Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem Summary

**Issue**: Approved voters were being redirected to an "ineligible" page when trying to vote, despite having approved accreditation status in the database.

**Root Cause**: The test script `test-complete-voting.sh` was using incorrect field names when creating voter accreditation records, causing the creation to fail silently.

## Technical Details

### The Bug

In `test-complete-voting.sh`, voter accreditation was being created with:

```bash
App\Models\VoterAccreditation::create([
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'election_id' => $ELECTION_ID,
    'status' => 'approved',
    'approved_at' => now(),     # ❌ WRONG FIELD
    'approved_by' => 1          # ❌ WRONG FIELD
]);
```

### The Correct Fields

According to the migration `2025_05_29_075359_create_voter_accreditations_table.php`, the correct fields are:

-   `reviewed_at` (not `approved_at`)
-   `reviewed_by` (not `approved_by`)

### Database Schema

```php
Schema::create('voter_accreditations', function (Blueprint $table) {
    // ... other fields ...
    $table->enum('status', ['pending', 'approved', 'rejected'])->default('pending');
    $table->datetime('reviewed_at')->nullable();
    $table->foreignId('reviewed_by')->nullable()->constrained('users')->onDelete('set null');
    // ... other fields ...
});
```

## Voting Eligibility Flow

The voter eligibility check follows this path:

1. **User accesses ballot**: `/elections/{election}/ballot` → `VotingController::ballot()`
2. **Eligibility check**: `VotingService::canUserVote($userId, $electionId)`
3. **Repository check**: `VoterAccreditationRepository::isUserAccredited($userId, $electionId)`
4. **Database query**:
    ```php
    VoterAccreditation::where('user_id', $userId)
        ->where('election_id', $electionId)
        ->where('status', 'approved')
        ->exists();
    ```
5. **Result**: If `false`, user is redirected to "ineligible" page

## Files Modified

### 1. Fixed Test Script

**File**: `/Users/dans.io/development/mobile-voting/test-complete-voting.sh`

**Before**:

```bash
App\Models\VoterAccreditation::create([
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'election_id' => $ELECTION_ID,
    'status' => 'approved',
    'approved_at' => now(),
    'approved_by' => 1
]);
```

**After**:

```bash
App\Models\VoterAccreditation::create([
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'election_id' => $ELECTION_ID,
    'organization_id' => $user->organization_id,
    'status' => 'approved',
    'applied_at' => now(),
    'reviewed_at' => now(),
    'reviewed_by' => 1
]);
```

### 2. Created Debug Scripts

-   **`test-voter-eligibility.php`**: Comprehensive eligibility testing
-   **`validate-voter-eligibility.php`**: Setup validation and test data creation
-   **`fix-voter-eligibility.sh`**: Automated fix script

## Verification Steps

### 1. Run the Fix Script

```bash
cd /Users/dans.io/development/mobile-voting
chmod +x fix-voter-eligibility.sh
./fix-voter-eligibility.sh
```

### 2. Manual Test

1. Login with test credentials:
    - Email: `barbara.turner.1@techpro.org`
    - Password: `password`
2. Navigate to: `/elections/5/ballot`
3. Verify voter can access the ballot page

### 3. Database Verification

```sql
SELECT id, user_id, election_id, status, reviewed_at, reviewed_by
FROM voter_accreditations
WHERE status = 'approved';
```

## Expected Results After Fix

✅ **VotingService Test**:

-   `canUserVote()` returns `['can_vote' => true, 'reason' => '']`
-   Repository `isUserAccredited()` returns `true`

✅ **Web Interface**:

-   Approved voters can access `/elections/{id}/ballot`
-   No redirection to "ineligible" page
-   Voting functionality works as expected

✅ **Database State**:

-   Voter accreditations have correct field values
-   `reviewed_at` and `reviewed_by` are properly set
-   All required fields (`organization_id`, `applied_at`) are populated

## Future Prevention

1. **Field Validation**: Always verify field names against migration files
2. **Testing**: Use proper Laravel testing instead of manual scripts
3. **Error Handling**: Add better error reporting for failed database operations
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of database schema changes

## Test Credentials

For manual testing:

-   **Email**: `barbara.turner.1@techpro.org`
-   **Password**: `password`
-   **Election ID**: `5`
-   **Ballot URL**: `http://localhost:8000/elections/5/ballot`

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Date**: May 30, 2025  
**Impact**: Critical voting functionality restored
